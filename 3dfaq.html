    <a name="how-submit"></a><br><b>How to submit a 3D print</b>

    <p>
      Log into your <a href="customer-dashboard.php">dashboard</a> and click on submit new print job. Upload a 3D file and fill out the fields. Click submit. If you want to know what infill, layer height, scale, and whether to use supports or not please read what those specifications mean below. If you have specific questions regarding your print; email us at <a href="mailto:dscommons@uvic.ca">dscommons@uvic.ca</a> or submit a job with what you think you want and leave a note in the options. We will help out and answer any questions you may have. Once submitted, your print job will go through the following steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Submitted: Your print job has been submitted via the create new print in the <a href="customer-dashboard.php">customer dashboard.</a> After submission, the DSC will evaluate the cost. If we have any concerns or require clarification with your request, the DSC will email you prior to pricing your print job.</li>
      <li>Pending Payment: Once the print is accepted, you'll receive an email with the cost and link to the online payment.</li>
      <li>Paid: After payment is received, your print will be placed in the print queue on a first come, first served basis.</li>
      <li>Printing: The item is currently being printed.</li>
      <li>Completed: The item has finished printing and can be collected from the front desk in the McPherson library.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Canceled: After 2 weeks of pending payment, the print will automatically be cancelled and need to be resubmitted should it need to be printed. The DSC will not cancel a print if it has not been priced or if it has been paid.</li>
      <li>Archived: The item has been printed. The .stl or .obj file may have been deleted.</li>
    </ul>


      <a name="specs"></a><br><b>Infill</b>
        <p>
          The infill is the percentage of the inside of the print that is filled with material. A higher infill makes the object sturdy and able to bear more weight, but can significantly increase the cost. Most decorative items can have 5-10% infill. Having no infill is not advised, unless the object was specifically designed to be printed with zero infill. Increasing the size will also increase the amount of material used, increasing the cost. In the image below, you'll see the number of shells each print has. The number of shells or shell thickness is how thick the outside layer is. A thicker shell increase strength but also increase cost. Thicker shells can also be usefull for post processing, as sanding or refining a print can remove shells and extra shells prevent ruining the print. For additional shells please note this in the additional comment section of your print or jobs will be printed with default shell thickness.
        </p>
        <img class = "mid" src="img/infill.jpg" alt="10, 5, and 20 percent infill">
        <br>

        <b>Scale</b>

        <p>
          The scale is the size of the print by comparison to the size it was designed to be. Many models are printed at 100% scale, but it is also common to change the size. Keep in mind: when decreasing model size, you will also be decreasing wall thickness and the size of detail. This can result in a loss of quality when printing, if taken too far.
        </p>

        <b>Layer Height</b>

        <p>
          3D printing is done by slicing the digital object horizontally into layers, then printing each layer one at a time. Layer height is the thickness of each slice. The smaller the layer height, the finer the detail of the finished print. Small layer heights take significantly longer to print because more layers are needed. Standard print jobs are printed at 0.2mm layer height and for most jobs, this is the best option. The Makerbot printers will print to as fine as 0.1mm and the Ultimaker 3 will print down to a 0.06mm layer height
        </p>

        <b>Supports</b>

        <p>
          It’s generally best to have Supports turned on. The printing software we use will only generate supports where needed. We offer two option for support materials; regular PLA supports, which break off after printing but can leave aesthetic marks and may require sanding to get rid off. The alternative is water soluble PVA supports, which allow supports to be built in places that PLA supports would be difficult or impossible to remove. PVA supports also dont leave aesthtic marks, creating a nicer initial finish. However, PVA costs more at 20 cents per gram and increases printing times.

        <h4>Copies</h4>
          <p>
            Printing multiple copies at the same time can be more efficient, however it must fit on the printing area.
          </p>

      <a name="mats"></a><b>Material</b>
        <ol>
          <li>PLA (Polylactic Acid)
            <ul>
              <li>A form of plastic made from natural starches like cornstarch that will biodegrade in some industrial composting facilities.</li>
              <li>Can be used for supports.</li>
              <li>Comes in a variety of colors.</li>
              <li>Costs 10 cents per gram.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>PVA Dissolving Filament
            <ul>
              <li>Also made from starch. It dissolves when you put it in water.</li>
              <li>Primarialy used for supports.</li>
              <li>We charge 20 cents per gram</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <ul>
              <li>A material with medium flex</li>
              <li>We charge 20 cents per gram</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      <a name="time"></a><b>Wait Times</b>
        <p>This varies depending on the time of the semester. During end of term, when projects are due, it may take a couple of weeks or more. A single print job can potentially take many hours and jobs are done on a first come, first served basis. If it is a slow time, turnaround is less than a week.</p>
      <a name="cost"></a><b>Pricing</b>
        <p>The cost is determined by the weight and type of material used. Material costs vary from 10 cents to 20 cents per gram. Supports and rafts are included in the cost.</p>
      <br>
      <a name="color"></a><b>Color</b>
        <p>We have a variety of colors in PLA filament available. If you have a color requiremnt, please mention it in the additional comment section.</p>
        <p>Two-colour printing is possible with the DSC’s Ultimaker 3. Here are some things to note while creating your object:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To complete a print, projects need to be exported in either a .’obj’ file (TinkerCad and other software such as SolidWorks) or ‘.amf’ file (SolidWorks).</li>
          <li>Before exporting your complete .obj file, make sure to group objects of the same colour together and export each as a different file. These will fit together for printing to complete your two colour creation.</li>
          <li>Make sure to communicate your colour preferences when requesting a print job; to make sure that your colour choices are available at the DSC.</li>
          <li>Note: Dissolving PVA Supports are not available with two colour print jobs.</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Where to collect a finished print</h4>
        <p>Once a print is finished printing, an email will be sent and the print can be collected from the front desk of the McPherson library.</p>
      <br>
      <a name="file"></a><b>Accepted File Types</b>
        <p>.stl, .obj .3mf, and .gcode files are accepted that are less than 200MB. For larger files, please contact the DSC first at <a href="mailto:dscommons@uvic.ca">dscommons@uvic.ca</a></p>
    <br>
    <a name="appearence"></a><b>Final print differences</b>
      <p>When submitting your print, be aware that the final result may not look exactly as the 3D file you submitted. Intricate details can be lost as the printer may not be able to print as fine. If a detailed print is required, a finer layer setting is reccomended (0.06 is the finest layer height offered). Supports and rafts will be left on and need to be removed carefully (or dissolved in water for PVA supports)).</p>

    <h3>Basics</h3>

      <a name="what-is"></a><b>The basics of 3D printing</b>
        <p>There are several ways to print objects in 3 dimensions. The printers at the DSC do it by Fused Deposition Modeling. A digital 3D model is first cut up into horizontal layers. Our printers then take filament on spools into a heated extruder. The extruder melts the material and draws the layer onto a flat surface called a buildplate. Once a layer is finished, the buildplate lowers and the second layer is drawn on top of the first layer. This continues until all layers have been printed. </p>
